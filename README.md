PokeFontDS
==============
PokeFontDS is a font editor for DS Pokemon games(D/P/Pt/HG/SS/B/W/B2/W2).

The program was originally developed by evco1, but the only existing and the most recent version(2.2.0.0) had a (very) little bug, which prevented it from loading fonts from Gen 4 Pokemon games.
This project is a continuation of the original tool, with a better UI and some other minor additions.

Current version: 3.0 beta (2.3.0.0 internally)
